CHANGELOG

## WIP - v0.7.0 - WIP:

### Bug Fixes
* Fix 42: Hide new line separator in response stub
* Fix subscription name with space in their name
* Fix #45: Crash when empty line in subscription file

## v0.6.0:

**Major release**

### Breaking changes:
* Shortcut to create a new entry is now "N" (uppercase) and no longer ctrl+n.

### New features:
* Implements region in timeline TextView: This will allow to navigate between entries using J and K (uppercase)
* #28: stubs for new entry: Clicking on "N" (uppercase) will copy in the clipboard a stub for a new entry with the current date if the option `tui_copy_stub_clipboard` is set (see README).
* #28: stubs for response: When selecting entry with J/K, using "R" (uppercase) will copy a pre-formatted response in your clipboard if the option `tui_copy_stub_clipboard` is set (see README).
* #33: Open links in entries, relates to #23. When using J/K to select an entry, using "O" will automatically open the link in the entry. If more than one link is in the entry, a popup will ask for one (or all) link(s) to open.
* #37: Implement a gemini compatible output
* #36: Show the tinylog entry being replied to: When selecting an entry with J/K, if the entry is a response to another tinylog entry and in the RFC format for a response, it will show the original entry in a popup when using "T" (uppercase)?
* #35: parser v2: Improve parser to be compatible with proposition 15 of the RFC (https://codeberg.org/bacardi55/gemini-tinylog-rfc/issues/15) that allow multiple break line in posts. Also improve parsing in general.
* Implement a modal for entry details via alt+enter
* Implement `tui_show_stub` option to show the stub to copy instead (or additionally) of copying it to the clipboard. Can be useful if you run gtl without X and/or are using tools like tmux to copy texts. Idea is from @szczezuja.
* Implement entry selection via mouse left click and simplify highlights code.

### Smaller improvements:
* [TUI] Add optional limit to number of displayed entries: Allow to limit the number of entries displayed in the timeline. See `tui_max_entries` option in README.
* Use gemini://tinylogs.gmi.bacardi55.io/ as default subscripton when no subscription file is found.
* Update dependencies
* Remove dead code

### Bug fixes
* Improve gemtext formating for level 3 headers and lists.
* Fix #29: Timeline refresh was previous refresh
* Fix error for missing file: if a tinylog isn't available on a working capsule, status was wrong.
* Fix limit bug in cli mode
* Remove date format duplicate

### Known Issues:
* Text in modal is not nicely formatted (eg: Thread or reply stub). This is due to an issue in cview: https://code.rocketnine.space/tslocum/cview/issues/72

Please read the README that has been updated accordingly.
