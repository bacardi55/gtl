# Installation


## From Source

gtl requires go â‰¥ 1.16

```
git clone http://git.bacardi55.io/bacardi55/gtl.git
cd gtl
make dependencies
make build
```

Put the binary in a directory available in your $PATH if you don't want to type the full path to the program.

## From Binaries

You can download binaries for linux [here](https://github.com/bacardi55/gtl/releases).
Binaries are only available for linux 386, amd64, arm and arm64 for now.

*PS*: I don't have a Mac or Windows box easily accessible, so any help/patch on this is appreciated :).
